# Phylogenetic Trees for "Mosaic brain evolution in woodpeckers and its relationship to extraordinary beak behavior"

## Overview
This directory contains the phylogenetic trees used for Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR), Phylogenetic PCA (pPCA), and PGLS analyses.

## Tree Files

### 1. `Tree_Piciformes_Expanded_2018.nex`
**Description:** The "Fuxjager Tree" (Expanded Piciformes).
*   **Source:** Adapted from Miles et al. (2018).
*   **Format:** NEXUS.
*   **Usage:** Used as one of the three backbone phylogenies for robustness testing in pPCA and PGLS comparisons.

### 2. `Tree_Piciformes_Consensus.nwk`
**Description:** The "Consensus Tree" (`pcf_tree`).
*   **Source:** A consensus topology derived from multiple avian phylogenies (e.g., Ericson backbone).
*   **Format:** Newick.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Main PGLS Analysis:** Primary tree used for reporting physiological comparisons.
    *   **ASR:** Used for the Ancestral State Reconstruction in Figure 3.
    *   **Figure 4:** Used for the ecological trends analysis.

### 3. `Tree_Piciformes_Ultrametric.nwk`
**Description:** The "Ultrametric Tree".
*   **Source:** Date-calibrated version of the consensus topology.
*   **Format:** Newick.
*   **Usage:** Used for comparative analyses requiring ultrametric branch lengths (e.g., initial ASR checks, though final ASR uses Consensus). Also used as the third robustness check in PGLS.

### 4. `Tree_Picidae_Pruned_Miles2018.nwk`
**Description:** A pruned tree focused specifically on the Picidae family.
*   **Source:** Based on Miles et al. (2018).
*   **Format:** Newick.
*   **Usage:** Reference for ensuring correct species matching within the Woodpecker clade specifically.

## Notes
*   All trees are automatically pruned within the R script (`name.check`) to match the species present in the ecological datasets before analysis.
